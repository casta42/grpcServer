CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindDotNET.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "DotNET", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "DotNET" with any
  of the following names:

    DotNETConfig.cmake
    dotnet-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "DotNET" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "DotNET_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "DotNET"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
