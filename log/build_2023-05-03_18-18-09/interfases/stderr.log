CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddotnet_csharp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "dotnet_csharp", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dotnet_csharp"
  with any of the following names:

    dotnet_csharpConfig.cmake
    dotnet_csharp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dotnet_csharp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "dotnet_csharp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "dotnet_csharp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
