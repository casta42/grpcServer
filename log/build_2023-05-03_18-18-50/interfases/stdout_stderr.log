CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddotnet.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "dotnet", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dotnet" with any
  of the following names:

    dotnetConfig.cmake
    dotnet-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dotnet" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "dotnet_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "dotnet"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
